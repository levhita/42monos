I was busy last month, so my monthly contribution did not materialize. But I'm back this month with a peaceful song that may be appropriate for town music (or potentially other areas as well).

My wife named it based on a phrase found in a Murakami Haruki book. The song is now called 小確幸, but you can refer to it by the title of the file instead.
