# History
Tomas wakes up in his bed as in every classic action RPG game in existence. Tomas start's to look trougth
the how looking for his family, first his little sister room, she is no there, weird she never wakes up so
early, goes down to the crafts room looking for his mom, but she is not there... weird, she is usually
inventing something while "the creative juices are still fresh"... goes to the kitchen, dad's not there
weird... he is usually making eggs with bacon for breakfast...


Tomas goes out of the house and it's empty, not a soul to be seen. Tomas' house is on the extreme west
of the town, he walks east around the empty town that has signs of a fight, he founds a sword, he better
take it, it might be dangerous to go alone.

Following the clues leads to a small group of enemies in the east exit of the town that have one of
the residents in a cage. After fighting them Tomas liberates the caged citizen. ¡THE MAYOR!

Tomas learns that a group on Ninja Cats kidnapped the towns people and intended to force the Mayor
to pay a big sum for their rescue. The worst part they took Tomas' family.

They took the east path, you should hurry up to catch them.


# Levels
Levels are designed with clear paths from start to end (either west to east of north to south, with
rectangular levels), not totally open but with a good ammount of porosity that allows the player to
enter every open fight area from a couple of places.

In every level there are 7 monos to be rescued, 3 on the main path, 3 on alternative paths clear
from the main path, one in a hidden spot that needs two or more World Progession abilities.

The hidden mono gives Tomas an extra hearth container.

6 levels, 7 monos per level = 42 monos

Each level has a rescued counter (5/7 monos rescued) to encourage the player to explore, altought is
not required, Tomas is looking for his family after all.

## 1.- Forest
Just outside Tomas's town.

## 2.- Deep Forest
You find The Archer in an alternative path when your progression get's halted by a moving bridge
which you cannot access.

## 3.- Ice Mountains
You find The Wizard in an alternative path when your progression get's halted by a river that you
cannot cross (the pirates are covering their tracks, this time they broken a dam to flood the river.)

## 4.- Arid Mountains
You find The BlackSmith in an alternative path when your progression get's halted by a groups of rocks
that you cannot remove(the pirates are covering their tracks, this time they made a landslide)

## 5.- Beach
You explore a beach biome and eventually find the pirate port at the extreme east, were you take a
boat to the pirate island.

## 6.- Pirate Island
The pirate island being the last level has no need to push the player to the east, so it's the most
open world one (and square) of all the levels, aimed mainly at battles, with the members of Tomas'
family distributed in several camps.

Mom is in the port were Tomas arrives, she managed to get hold on one of the keys need to rescue
the little sister, she also knows Dad's location and give The Archer a Bow that makes double the
damage.

Dad is in the camp near the port, he managed to get hold on the second key needed to rescue your little
sister, he pin point's the location of your sister and gives Tomas a sword that makes double the damage.

Armed with this two elements (now both the quick sword and the remote arrows do normal damage on frozen
enemies), Tomas can now fight the higher level enemies present in the island, giving a new life to the
game mechanics.

The trick about hidding the sister behind a door with keys (not used before in the game), is to force the
upgrade for the final boss battle, where a miriad of high level enemies will be present and we want
to give the player good feel of hard earned power(I hate when you get the powerful sword at end but
you cannot actually enjoy it)
